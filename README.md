## What is this?
My attempt at writing a scalable distributed cache on top of SignalR.

## How do I run it?

1. Run `CacheR.Server.exe` (by default it'll run on port 91).
2. Run 2 instances of the `CacheR.Client.Sample.exe`.

The instructions in the client sample should be clear. You should be able to add a value in one client and have it be available in the other immediately

## Can I use this?
This is far from production ready but if you're interesting in using it, let me know, I'd love the feedback.
